# Pointers exercise

In your clone of this repository, find the `4-pointers` exercise and list the files

```bash
$ cd archer2-cpp/exercises/4-pointers
$ ls
Makefile    pointers.cpp
```

Follow the instructions in `pointers.cpp` to test your understanding of pointers.

After each step, you should print variables as directed and check the results are what you expect.

**Reminder:**

- You can get a pointer to an object using `&` (the *address of* operator)

- You can read or write the value-that-is-pointed-to with `*` (the *dereference* operator)
